Part (c) plots the difference between these two quantities ($N(\Phi _{\text  {TCL4}})-N(\Phi _{\text  {TCL2}})$), while (d) shows the $L_2$ norm ratio $||F^{(4)}||_2/||F^{(2)}||_2$, highlighting the regime where TCL4 remains valid. The black line marks the Markovian regime from the resonance condition. The BLP measure is maximized over $400$ antipodal Bloch sphere pairs.\relax }}{1}{}\protected@file@percent }
