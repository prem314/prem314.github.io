# Flaws of ‘USS Callister’, Black Mirror:S4E1

USS Callister, despite all of its flaws that I am going to mention, is one of the best sci-fi video (movie? story?) I have seen. This is what makes the flaws harder to handle. There is some significant potential missed here.

The plot is amazing and is explored in a beautiful manner. Daly is a socially awkward genius nerd coder gets sidelined (bullied?) by people technically less capable than him, in a company he cofounded.
He is the brains behind an immersive online video game which you can play by pasting a small chip on your brain, which transports your senses to the game world.
But Daly has his own private version of the game, inhabited by the copy of the consciousness of all his coulleagues he does not like.
His copy of the game is styled in an old star trek like show that he is obsessed with.
Daly is the captain of a spaceship in the game, the copy of the consciousness of his coulleagues are other characters like crews and enemies of the game.
The crew retains the memory of their real life untill their consciousness was copied.
While Daly can log into the game whenever he wants to play it, the rest of the characters are permanent members and trapped in it against their wish.
Yet, they play along with the plot and premise of the game, the reason for which is later revealed to be that Daly has complete power over them in the game and can make them suffer without ever killing them.
This is Daly's way of coping with any coulleague of his who he feels has wronged him.

Now getting to the flaws of the show. Although the repurcussion of the plot is explored nicely, the story is plagued with LAZY writing, which makes it difficult to take it too seriously. I will give example.
