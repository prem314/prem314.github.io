# Flaws of ‘USS Callister’, Black Mirror:S4E1

USS Callister, despite all of its flaws that I am going to mention, is one of the best sci-fi video (movie? story?) I have seen. This is what makes the flaws harder to handle. There is some significant potential missed here.

The plot is amazing and is explored in a beautiful manner. Daly is a socially awkward genius nerd coder who gets sidelined (bullied?) by people technically less capable than him, in a company he cofounded.
He is the brain behind an immersive online video game which you can play by pasting a small chip on your brain, which transports your senses to the game world.
But Daly has his own private version of the game, inhabited by the copy of the consciousness of all his coulleagues he does not like.
His copy of the game is styled in an old star trek like show that he is obsessed with.
Daly is the captain of a spaceship in the game, the copy of the consciousness of his coulleagues are other characters like crews and enemies of the game.
The crew retains the memory of their real life untill their consciousness was copied.
While Daly can log into the game whenever he wants to play it, the rest of the characters are permanent members and trapped in it against their wish.
Yet, they play along with the plot and premise of the game, the reason for which is later revealed to be that Daly has complete power over them in the game and can make them suffer without ever killing them.
This is Daly's way of coping with any coulleague of his who he feels has wronged him.

Now getting to the flaws of the show. Although the repurcussion of the plot is explored nicely, the story is plagued with LAZY writing, which makes it difficult to take it too seriously. I will give example.

  - When Daly creates a copy of a person's consciousness for the game, as I said before, the copied person remembers about their past life uptill the point the copy is made. And how does he achieve this? Just from some DNA samples of the person! Now, I can imagine that the DNA may encode how the person will look, although I am dobtful about this. BUT, DNA simply does not encode the memories of the person. Writing cannot get lazier. They could gave made it logically sound by having Daly replace the personal chip that the person in question uses to interact with the digital world with a modified one, which also sends the estimated weights and biases of the user's neural network to Daly's computer. So, over a couple of days (weeks?) of use, all the terabytes of data is slowly transfered to Daly.
  - An update to the game manifests itself as a wormhole which the crew uses to commit suicide and avoid the prolonged torture. Wormhole? Seriously? I know they need to dumb down the technicalities in a visual manner so that even laymen can understand it, but this is simply cliche. I think there are more logical ways for the crew to commit suicide. They already blackmailed a real life person to delete the DNA samples from Daly's fridge to prevent him from creating another copy of themselves. They could have asked the same person to simply wipe Daly's hardrive! Instead, they put a wormhole and a cat and mouse chase scene. Moreover, enetering the wormhole enabled them to get to the online version of the game, escaping Daly. Well, again, same can be achieved through different manner.
  - The final point: Their brilliant plan, as I mentioned, is to have their DNA samples in Daly's possession to be destroyed, so that he cannot recreate them. BUT, they are already digital. 0's and 1's. How do they know that Daly would not keep a backup of their code somewhere? Lazy writing!
