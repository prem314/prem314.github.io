# Weighted squates vs Body Weight Single legged squates

## Summary
The load on single leg from body weight single legged squates will be the same as weighted squates if the weight in the latter is *equal* to the weight of the person!

## Calculation

Assuming that legs of a person weighs 32% of the full body weight. So, if a person of mass M is doing weighted squates with W weight, then the total weight on each leg is $(W + 0.68 M)/2$.

On the other hand, if a person does single legged squates, then weight on the leg is $0.84 M$. Equating these two, we get

$$ W/2 + 0.34 M = 0.84 M$$

$$\implies W/2 = 0.5 M$$

$$\implies W = M$$

\begin{align}
\frac{W}{2} + 0.34\,M &= 0.84\,M \\
\implies \frac{W}{2} &= 0.5\,M \\
\implies W &= M
\end{align}

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{W}{2} + 0.34\,M &= 0.84\,M \\
\implies \frac{W}{2} &= 0.5\,M \\
\implies W &= M
\end{align}
$$



## Comments
  - Single leg squates can also be great for stability and put less load on spine.
  - Single leg squates appears safer from injuries and does not require equipments.
  - Weighted squates can be great to train the spine for load and core strengthening.
