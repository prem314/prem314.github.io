# eighted squates vs Body Weight Single legged squates

## Summary
The load on single leg from body weight single legged squates will be the same as weighted squates if the weight is the latter is *equal* to the weight of the person!

## Calculation

Assuming that legs of a person weighs 32% of the full body weight. So, if a person of mass M is doing weighted squates with W weight, then the total weight on each leg is $W/2 + 0.68 M/2$.

On the other hand, if a person does single legged squates, then weight on the leg is $0.84 * M$. Equating these two, we get

$$ W/2 + 0.34 M = 0.84 M$$
$$\implies W/2 = 0.5 M$$
$$\implies W = M$$
