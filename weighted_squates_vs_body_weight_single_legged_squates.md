# Weighted squates vs Body Weight Single legged squates

## Summary
The load on single leg from body weight single legged squates will be the same as weighted squates if the weight in the latter is *equal* to the weight of the person!

## Calculation

Assume the mass of a person is $M$ and the weight of their both legs is $x M$. Then, if the person does squates with weight $W$, then the weight on single leg will be $(W + (1-x) M)/2$.

If the person does sigle leg body weight squates, then the weight on single leg will be $(1- x/2) M$. Equating these two to find the value of $W$, we get

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{W + (1-x)M}{2} &= (1 - x/2) M \\
\implies W + (1-x)M &= (2 - x) M \\
\implies W &= M
\end{align}
$$

Surprisingly, the final result does not even depend upon the value of $x$. Neat! But following study suggests that $x \approx 0.33$.[^1]


## Comments
  - Single leg squates can also be great for stability and put less load on spine.
  - Single leg squates appears safer from injuries and does not require equipments.
  - Weighted squates can be great to train the spine for load and core strengthening.
