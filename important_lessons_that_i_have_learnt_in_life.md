# Important lessons that I have learnt in life

  - Make notes. Human memory if volatile and there is beauty in not starting from scratch the next time you revisit something. I recommend maintaining a personal wikipedia. My recommendation is Obsidian. Perfect for non-STEM people. Easiest to set up. For more advanced users, I recommend Dokuwiki or vimwiki. But paper notes also work. I guess.
