# Weighted squates vs Single legged squates

Assuming that legs of a person weighs 32% of the full body weight. So, if a person of mass M is doing weighted squates with W weight, then the total weight on each leg is $W + 0.34 M$.

On the other hand, if a person does single legged squates, then weight on the leg is $0.84 * M$. Equating these two, we get

$$ W + 0.34 M = 0.84 M$$
$$\implies W = 0.5 M$$
